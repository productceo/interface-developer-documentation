# Roadmap

This page will be replaced with an interactive user voice tool where developers can suggest and vote on features. In the meantime, please share with me your ideas on [CV Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/) or [AR Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/), both of which I monitor everyday.

Here is the plan for 2020:

1. [x] Minimum Viable Product
   1. [x] Users can take a photo and send to a specific vision app.
   2. [x] Developers can register and service vision apps.
2. [ ] User Experience
   1. [ ] Users can browse and search for vision apps.
   2. [ ] Users can see recent vision apps.
   3. [ ] Users can see recommended vision apps.
3. [ ] Augmented Reality
   1. [ ] Users can send audio as input after providing consent.
   2. [ ] Users can send location as input after providing consent.
   3. [ ] Developers can display 3D objects using WebAR.
4. [ ] Developer Console
   1. [ ] Developers can edit or delete the vision apps they have registered.
   2. [ ] Developers can monitor their vision apps.

Backlog of experience improvements:

1. [ ] If camera is completely black, inform user to unblock camera by lifting from desk or removing their finger or phone case from the camera.
